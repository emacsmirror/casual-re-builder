* Casual RE-Builder
An opinionated [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]]-based menu for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Regular-Expressions.html][RE-Builder]], a tool for building Emacs regular expressions (regexps).

[[file:docs/images/casual-re-builder-screenshot.png]]

* Motivation
While highly functional, RE-Builder has a steep learning curve to its many commands. Menus can lower this curve by offering users discoverability and recall. While menus are commonly associated with mouse-driven UI, the inclusion of Transient in Emacs core allows for a menu UI that is keyboard-driven. Casual RE-Builder endeavors to offer this as many Emacs users prefer keyboard-driven workflows.

** Goals
- To provide a keyboard-driven menu UI for RE-Builder.
- To provide casual access to the RE-Builder command set.

** Non-Goals
- Strict adherence to RE-Builder command naming. While Casual RE-Builder is *mostly* in alignment with RE-Builder’s command naming, there are cases where it will make an opinionated change if the name is deemed too vague or idiomatic.
- UX Stability (for now). Given that Casual RE-Builder is early in its life-cycle, expect changes to its user experience in terms of menu hierarchy and keybinding choices in future releases.

* Requirements
Casual RE-Builder has been verified with the following configuration. 
- Emacs 29.4 (macOS 14.5, Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4 LTS)

* Asks
As Casual RE-Builder is new, we are looking for early adopters! Your [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-re-builder/discussions][feedback]] is welcome as it will likely impact Casual RE-Builder's evolution, particularly with regards to UI.

* Install
If installed via MELPA then add these lines to your Emacs initialization file with your binding of preference. 
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-re-builder) ;; optional
  (keymap-set reb-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-re-builder-tmenu)
  (keymap-set reb-lisp-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-re-builder-tmenu)
#+end_src

If you use ~use-package~, here is the recipe for installing it.
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 're-builder)
  (use-package casual-re-builder
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map reb-mode-map
                ("C-o" . casual-re-builder-tmenu)))
#+end_src


* Usage

** Basic Usage
When the command ~re-builder~ is invoked, a buffer named "✳︎RE-Builder✳︎" is created. Activate Casual RE-Builder with the binding ~C-o~ (or one of your preference). 

At the top of the menu shows the title "RE-Builder" with the target buffer enclosed in parenthesis. The regexp pattern will be applied to the target buffer. The target buffer can be changed with the /(b) Target buffer/ menu item.

Emacs supports three different regexp syntax: 1) read, 2) string, 3) Rx.  Use the /(x) Syntax/ menu item to alter it. The current syntax is shown in parenthesis.

If multiple sub-expressions are in the regexp pattern, then they can be observed via the /(s) Subexp mode/ menu item.

If the regexp pattern entered in the "✳︎RE-Builder✳︎" finds multiple matches, a match can be navigated to via the /(p) Previous/ and /(n) Next/ menu items.

** Exporting the Regexp Pattern
Once a desired regexp pattern is defined, there are two menu items that can be used to export (copy) it to the kill-ring for further use.

- /(w) Interactive/ will copy the regexp to the kill-ring so that it can be yanked in an interactive command that requires a regexp (e.g. ~isearch-forward-regexp~).
  - This should only be used when the regexp syntax is set to ~string~. 
- /(c) Code/ will copy the regexp to the kill-ring so that it can be yanked into a Elisp code that requires a regexp argument.

** Regexp Syntax Help
The menu item /(i)/ will invoke the Info page for regexp syntax with respect to the current syntax type.

** Quitting RE-Builder
Select /(q) Quit/ to exit the RE-Builder tool. 

** Unicode Symbol Support
By enabling “Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual RE-Builder will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus. The following mapping is shown in the table below:

| Name      | Plain    | Unicode |
|-----------+----------+---------|
| :previous | Previous | ↑       |
| :next     | Next     | ↓       |

* Common Menu Actions
Casual RE-Builder is built using Transient menus and as such adopts much of its default behavior.

Each menu item has a /key/ and a /label/. The /key/ is what is typed by the user to select the menu item. A key can be prefixed with a meta (M-) or control (C-) key. 

Dismissing a menu regardless of how deep you are in sub-menus can be done by entering ~C-q~. A menu can also be dismissed by entering ~C-g~, but this will return you to the parent menu.

If a mouse is available, a menu item can be selected by moving the mouse cursor over its label and pressing down button 1.

Pressing the ~?~ key will toggle help for all the menu items. Press the key of interest to get help for it.

Options such as ~--above~ and ~--below~ can be saved for future use by typing ~C-x C-s~.

When a Transient menu is raised, a prefix argument (~C-u~) can be entered before selecting a menu item.
